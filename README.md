## Overview
 Acme Robotics Inc. aims to explore new realms in defense robotics by developing a
quadrotor drone capable for exploring an unknown user-defined land patch and
collect intelligence (number of hostages & terrorists) all the while developing a map
of the explored area. The scope of this project is to develop the end-to-end software
package for the above-mentioned drone operation.
